Description: Concept maps are versatile tools used across disciplines to enhance understanding,
  teaching, brainstorming, and information organization. This package provides functions for
  processing and visualizing concept mapping data, involving the sequential use of cluster analysis 
  (for sorting participants and statements), multidimensional scaling (for positioning statements 
  in a conceptual space), and visualization techniques, including point cluster maps and 
  dendrograms. The methodology and its validity are discussed in Kampen, J.K., Hageman, J.A.,
  Breuer, M., & Tobi, H. (2025). "The validity of concept mapping: let's call a spade a spade."
